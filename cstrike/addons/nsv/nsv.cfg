// THIS FILE MUST BE PLACED IN YOUR <mod>/addons/nsv DIRECTORY (i.e., cstrike/addons/nsv)
//
// One entry per line, in one of the following formats...
// FORMAT:   cvarname
// FORMAT:   cvarname flag
// FORMAT:   cvarname "value" flag
//
// (no flag will default to a flag value of 8, which is generally the value that should be used to hide a cvar).
// Other values are provided for more advanced usage...
// 
// 1 = FCVAR_ARCHIVE		set to cause it to be saved to vars.rc
// 2 = FCVAR_USERINFO		changes the client's info string
// 4 = FCVAR_SERVER		notifies players when changed
// 8 = FCVAR_EXTDLL		defined by external DLL
// 16 = FCVAR_CLIENTDLL		defined by the client dll
// 32 = FCVAR_PROTECTED		It's a server cvar, but we don't send the data since it's a password, etc.  Sends 1 if it's not bland/zero, 0 otherwise as value
// 64 = FCVAR_SPONLY		This cvar cannot be changed by clients connected to a multiplayer server.
// 128 = FCVAR_PRINTABLEONLY	This cvar's string cannot contain unprintable characters ( e.g., used for player name etc ).
// 256 = FCVAR_UNLOGGED		If this is a FCVAR_SERVER, don't log changes to the log file / console if we are creating a log
//
// * Desired flag values for each cvar should be added together to create a single value.
// * Any changes/additions to the nsv.cfg file will require a map change before they take effect.
// * Any deletions from the nsv.cfg file will require a server restart before they take effect.
// * Values can also be assigned via the third format approach listed above. Quotes around the value are required!
//
// sample values - add or remove as you see fit, based on cvars you want to hide from the public.
